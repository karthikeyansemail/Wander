Not so long ago were the times when ‘Mental Health’ was given only superficial importance and
not enough heed to. But since the past two years, it has evolved to become a buzzword and talk
of the town. With the onset of pandemic and various lockdowns imposed, more people have
fallen prey to deteriorating mental health conditions. It has become so tough that many countries
have started observing mental health disorders and depression as critical health conditions.
Bereavement, isolation, loss of income, and fear are factors triggering these conditions or
exacerbating existing ones. With the pandemic, many people have also developed increased
levels of alcohol and drug use, anxiety, and insomnia.<br><br>
At the same time, COVID-19 alone can lead to neurological and mental complications, such as
delirium, agitation, and stroke. People with pre-existing mental, neurological or substance abuse
disorders are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection; they face a higher risk of suffering
severe outcomes and at times, even death.<br><br>
<b>Problem</b><br><br>
<b>A study by Assocham showed that nearly 43 percent of employees in the private sector in
India suffer from mental health issues at work.</b> Also, a WHO report in 2017 reveals that 18
percent of global depression cases originate from India.<br><br>
While mental health issues in the workplace are a reality for most companies, the stigma
associated with mental health problems often prevents people from seeking help.
To tackle this illness, one of the best and proven solutions is to travel and explore the world.<br><br>
<b>Did you know?</b><br><br>
<b>According to a Cornell University study, the anticipation of a trip can increase your
happiness substantially. Additionally, extended traveling also improves your productivity,
problem-solving skills and can even increase your chances of getting promoted at work.</b><br><br>
<b>What we do</b><br><br>
At Wanderfly, we provide you with a collection of the best-curated trip plans including
accommodation, food, logistic support, and team building activities. We cater you with the best
in-house adventurers and explorers to travel along your side and make your trip a memorable
experience.<br><br>
<b>Team Building Activities</b><br><br>
Evidently, it is a long-exercised custom today for corporates to increase employee-wellness via
fun activities and productive engagements. This can be on account of your crew’s well-deserved
time-out prior to a vital product launch or your firm’s accomplishment of a significant milestone.
Employees desire to be pampered from time to time – be it for their best work or above-par
industrious output,and rightfully so.<br><br>
An afternoon breather at a well-known resort, a gala crew lunch, or touring an enjoyment park –
all of them allow the crew to get together and collectively bask in a myriad of luxuries.
The purpose of group-outings also changes with time and the company process. Maybe your
purpose resonates with entertaining a trendy group of employees, or maybe you simply want to
welcome and entice the rookie talents with fantastic company perks. Many companies have also
inculcated a yearly group-bonding activity known as ‘Outbound Learning’, or simply, OBL.
Whatever your intention be, as an HR, Project Manager, or People Manager – if you aspire to
innovate a bit, are inclined to check new waters, explore offbeat outdoor trips, or trek to
breathtaking locations, this is where you can collaborate.<br><br>
At Wanderfly, we have discovered plenty of captivating points of interest like beaches, hills,
mountains, forests, lakes, waterfalls, and estates. This offers you with various lists of alternatives
to cherry-pick your favorite solution from.<br><br>
Spending time with mother nature through Wanderfly makes your experience more fulfilling and
provides you with an opportunity to build humane connections with fellow travelers in a
healthier way. We help you with travel to exciting destinations for you to conduct group-building
activities. The travel could include a range of games, select sightseeing tours, handpicked hikes,
wallowing under waterfalls, camping in stunning settings or engagement in adventurous sports
specific to location. These journeys
are designed to provide you with a sense of gratification and purpose irrespective of age, gender,
or hierarchy. You can customize your schedules, places, and activities with us.
There is nothing like spending a wholesome time collectively that takes crew-bonding to the next
level.<br><br>
Who knows what you will discover? You could probably find a hidden gem in your team. Your
close colleague could be a popular dancer, a rockstar musician, or an intellect sharing a similar
mindset.<br><br>
The endpoint of the trek is an assignment to triumph over a milestone of collective success.<br><br>
We wholeheartedly believe in the maxim– “Celebrate and cherish every moment in life!”.<br><br>
Wanderfly endeavors to be part of this philosophy and create more moments together.<br><br>
